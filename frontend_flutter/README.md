CourtWala – Final Year Project <br>

Built with Flutter, Firebase & Node.js <br><br>

CourtWala is a mobile application designed to simplify sports court bookings, team matchmaking, and community engagement for local players and court owners in Pakistan. <br><br>

The app provides a centralized platform where: <br>

Players can find and join matches or book courts easily. <br>

Court Owners can register and manage their courts online. <br>

Communities can stay connected through event posts, tournaments, and updates. <br><br>

By digitalizing the manual process of finding matches through WhatsApp groups or word-of-mouth,
CourtWala aims to build a more organized and connected sports ecosystem —
promoting accessibility, healthy activity, and stronger sports communities. <br><br>
